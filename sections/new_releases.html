    <h3>Spin relaxation of conduction electrons in coupled quantum wells.</h3>
    <p>The spin of the conduction-band electrons in a quantum well constitutes a promising two-level system for
      realizing a quantum bit in the solid state. One of the important parameters in the spin dynamics is their
      relaxation time. It is desired to develop models and semiconductor structures in order to control it. There are
      several reported examples of spin lifetime control in quantum wells. Double quantum wells in a semiconductor
      heterostructure allow the modulation of the relaxation time. By changing the relative thicknesses of the wells in
      the double quantum well system, the wave function for the lowest-energy level of the conduction band can be
      distributed symmetrically or asymmetrically with respect to the coupling barrier between the quantum wells to
      control the Dresselhaus and Rashba components of the spin-orbit coupling and, consequently, the relaxation time.
      To detect and characterize this effect, circularly polarized photoluminescence was used at low temperatures (19
      K). The results reported in the present paper suggest that this coupled double quantum well system enables the
      design of structures that allow for the control of the relaxation time and the performance of the electron spin as
      a quantum bit.</p>
