    <p>
      Greetings! As part of my work, I specialize in developing software with two primary purposes. The first
      focus is on the development and utilization of <strong>DFT</strong> (Density Functional Theory) code calculators
      to
      investigate the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of semiconductors. My expertise in
      <strong>Python</strong>,
      <strong>Julia</strong>, and <strong>Fortran</strong> allows me to create powerful and efficient computational
      tools for these purposes.

      The second aspect of my work involves creating codes for experimental endeavors, including instrumentation
      interfaces and the analysis of experimental results. This enables me to bridge the gap between theoretical
      simulations and practical laboratory work, enhancing the overall research process.

      With a strong background in programming and a passion for scientific computing, I continuously strive to
      push the boundaries of what is possible in the realms of computational physics and experimental research. My
      aim is to contribute significantly to the advancement of knowledge in these fields and to provide valuable
      tools for researchers and scientists alike.

      If you are interested in collaborating or would like to know more about my projects and contributions, feel
      free to reach out. I am always open to exploring new opportunities and engaging in exciting scientific
      ventures. Let's push the boundaries of scientific exploration together!
