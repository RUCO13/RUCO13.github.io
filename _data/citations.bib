abstract = {Circularly polarized photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measured at 19 K on GaAs/AlGaAs symmetric and asymmetric double quantum wells (DQW) is reported. The PL is obtained by exciting the sample with a circularly polarized (left or right) laser in order to create an initial unbalanced distribution of electron spins in the conduction band and, in this way, obtain the electron spin lifetime τ s . The effects of the excitation laser wavelength are estimated by exciting with laser wavelengths of 701.0, 787.0, 801.5, and 806.5 nm. The increase of τ s with the excitation wavelength is attributed to the lower initial quasimomentum k of the excited carriers, which also reduces spin–orbit relaxation processes. τ s is found to be higher in asymmetric DQWs: this is attributed to the wider QWs in these samples, which reduces spin relaxation due to the Dresselhaus mechanism. In addition, a smaller contribution from the Rashba mechanism is also detected by comparing samples with built-in electric fields of different orientations defined by doped barrier layers.},
